# Registry-specific sigstore configuration for Harbor.
# Install to /etc/containers/registries.d/harbor.yaml
#
# This tells Podman/containers tooling to look for Cosign (sigstore)
# signature attachments in the same registry when verifying images
# pulled from harbor.internal.
#
# Without this, Podman does not know where to find the signatures
# even if policy.json requires them.
#
# See: man containers-registries.d(5)
